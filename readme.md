# PoshTodo

This is a powershell CLI to the [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) todo file format with some PowerShell like features and alson taking inspiration from Taskwarrior.

Based originally on [PsTodoTxt](https://github.com/derantell/PsTodoTxt) it has been completely rewritten. 

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a command line interface to Todo.txt and add in some important Taskwarrior features such as prioritisation and ease of editing tasks.

## Todo.txt Components

Each task is split into Todo.txt components. These components are detailed in New-TodoObject.ps1

## Configuration format

PoshTodo's configuration format is stored in Get-TodoDefaultConfig.ps1
